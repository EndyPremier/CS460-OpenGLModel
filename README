itive body, it has up to 10 levels of primitives with every part of the model

  Each of the indents represents glPushMatrix() with some use of glTranslate(),
glRotate(), and glScale() for almost every cases.

  Sliders are used for almost every components like eyes, teeth, jaw, nose, and
ears and for the eyes in particular, that slider not only control the eye move-
ment but even the iris and pupil on the scalera of the eye.

  Cameras are somethign I haven't utilize since I cannot bother with the lack of 
tangible information such as the eye and the position to do transformation
sadly.

  Animation, I modified the modelerapp to add a getter procedure to see if ani-
mation is on and allow Rk to animate with expression and sway.

  For Beacons, note that the ears and the eyes - the scalera, the iris and the
pupil - makes extensive use of the triangles to form a semicircle and a prism
(2), and for the eyes in particular, the fidelity is associated to its graphics 
settings too (1).
